description: Audit a page, component, or file against WCAG 2.2 AA and report prioritised findings.

Run a WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit of: **$ARGUMENTS** (if empty, audit the frontend files in the current changes / working directory).

Use the `shadcn-accessibility-auditor` agent for a thorough pass, or do it inline for a small scope. Either way:

1. Load the `shadcn-accessibility` skill; use `references/wcag-2.2.md` as the criteria checklist and `references/testing.md` for method.
2. Determine the target: a local file (Read it), a described component, or the current diff. State clearly what you examined and acknowledge what you **cannot** verify statically (focus order in a real browser, screen-reader output, contrast of colours set via CSS theme variables) — recommend the manual/AT tests from `references/testing.md` for those.
3. Walk the four POUR principles. For each issue found, report:
   - **Criterion** (e.g. `1.1.1 Non-text Content`, Level A/AA)
   - **Severity** (Blocker / Major / Minor)
   - **Location** (`file:line`)
   - **What's wrong** and **the fix** (concrete code).
4. Prioritise: list Blockers and Majors first. Group the high-frequency checks (alt text, `Label`/input association, focus visibility via `focus-visible:ring`, heading order, contrast — especially `text-muted-foreground` on tinted surfaces — `lang`, announced errors, 24px target size).
5. Also flag **ad-hoc components** — a raw `<button>`/`<input>`/custom modal used where a shadcn/Radix primitive exists — since re-implementations discard the Radix accessibility baseline. This overlaps `/shadcn:review`; keep the focus here on the WCAG impact.
6. End with a short summary: counts by severity, and which criteria you could and could not assess statically.

Do not declare the page "WCAG 2.2 AA compliant" — automated/static review alone cannot establish that, and Radix primitives are a baseline, not a guarantee. Frame the result as findings plus the remaining manual tests needed.
